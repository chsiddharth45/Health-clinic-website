# 🏥 HealthyLife Clinic - Healthcare Appointment System

A simple, front-end healthcare appointment booking system. This app lets users view doctors, book appointments, and view appointment history — all with a clean dark-themed UI and no backend required.

## 🚀 Features

  Users can fill out a simple form with their name, doctor selection, and preferred date.

- 🧠 **Smart Tab Navigation**  
  Switch between the **Home** and **Dashboard** sections using tab buttons.

- 💾 **LocalStorage Integration**  
  Appointments are saved in the browser using `localStorage`, so data persists even after refreshing.

- 📋 **Patient Dashboard**  
  View a list of all previously booked appointments in a clean list format.

- 🌙 **Dark Theme UI**  
  Fully styled with a dark color palette and golden accent, ideal for night-time usage or aesthetic preference.

## 📌 Notes

- Data is saved only in the browser. Refreshing the browser retains appointments.
- This is a front-end-only project — no server or database integration.

## ✨ Future Improvements

- Add time slots to appointment booking
- Allow appointment cancellation/editing
- Add login system for patients
- Connect to backend/database (e.g., Firebase, Node.js, etc.)
